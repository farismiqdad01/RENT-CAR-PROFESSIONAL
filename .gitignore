```html
<!-- No build artifacts, dependencies, or temporary files detected in changes -->
<!-- Only HTML source files were modified -->
```

Wait, let me reconsider this. The input shows only HTML files were modified (`pages/kebijakan.html`, `pages/paket-natal.html`), which are source files. According to rule #6, if the changes contain only source/config files and no build artifacts, dependencies, or temp files, I should output an empty .gitignore.
